            <summary>MINI FILLS</summary>
            <p>Mini fills are meant to be a “pick me up” for your lashes</p>
            <p>Meaning, you MUST have 75% retention to book a mini fill. Mini fills are usually booked a week or so after your regular lash fill.</p>
            <p>I personally use mini fills for last minute events that I didn’t plan for when scheduling my two week fills.</p>
            <p>Mini fill are NOT meant to take place of your regular two week fill. Please book responsibly so that I don’t have to result in taking mini fills off my menu</p>
